    /**
     * Objective:
     * In this challenge, we're going to use loops to help us do some simple math.
     *
     * Task:
     * Given an Integer, N, print it's first 10 multiples.
     * Each multiple N x i (where 1 < i < 10) should be printed in a new line in the form:
     * N x i = result
     *
     * Input format:
     *
     * A single Integer, N.
     *
     * Constraints:
     * Print 10 lines of output; each line i (where 1 < i < 10) contains the result of N x i in the form:
     *
     * N x i = result
     *
     * Sample input:
     * 2
     *
     * Sample output:
     * 2 x 1 = 2
     * 2 x 2 = 4
     * 2 x 3 = 6
     * 2 x 4 = 8
     * 2 x 5 = 10
     * 2 x 6 = 12
     * 2 x 7 = 14
     * 2 x 8 = 16
     * 2 x 9 = 18
     * 2 x 10 = 20
